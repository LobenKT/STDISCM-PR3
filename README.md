STDISCM Programming Report 3: Distributed Prime Checker

Launch master2.py to start master-slave experiment setup, but it can also handle on its own the prime checking process. The master will distribute the prime checking task to the slaves, and the slaves will return the result to the master. The master will then print the result to the console.
